To make code for single precision:
make sp

To make code for double precision:
make dp

or "make all" to build both versions


You need to "make clean" between different builds,
 this is done automatically with the commands above.

All precision controled in precision_XX.f90 where :
XX = sp - single precision
XX = dp - double precision

Note that the flux routine is promoted to double precision
even in the single precision build defining the CUSTOM_FLUX
fortran kind as double precision.  You can use this kind
variable to promote other variables and functions to 
double precision even during the single precision build. 


small experiment with compiler flags (cray):
spresults/run1:  total time                   (s)          = 698.229309  "-O3"
spresults/run2:  total time                   (s)          = 695.925781  "-O3 -cpu=interlagos"
spresults/run3:  total time                   (s)          = 693.172302  "-O3 -cpu=interlagos -Oipa5"
